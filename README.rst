ORCID integration
==========================

This is a plugin for `pretalx`_, connecting pretalx users with ORCID. It adds
an additional, non-mandatory step in the CfP process, allowing submitters to
connect their ORCID account with their pretalx account.

Consequently, their name (as separate first and last name), their biography,
their title, and their organisation will be pre-filled from ORCID data.
(Additional data fields can be added â€“ please open a PR if you are missing a
field!)
